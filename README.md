# clock

Hello! This is a clock I have created for my Digital Studies 301: Creative Coding class. After looking at different methods for recording and tracking time throughout history, I decided that it would be fun to recreate a sort of "digital sun dial," which I have  attempted to do with this project.

My clock displays a basic sun dial with a moving "shadow" to indicate passing seconds. A sun and moon also travel around the sun dial to simulate how time is actually tracked using a real sun dial.


Prior to this project, I didn't really have any knowledge on how to create circular motions with objects or components in my sketch. So, for the movement of the sun and moon, I sourced a portion of my code from this sketch by kchung: https://editor.p5js.org/kchung/sketches/SJkdHhWUQ
I also referenced previous class lectures for the formatting of my clock, as well as the movement of the 'shadow.'
